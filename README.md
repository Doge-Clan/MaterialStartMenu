# MaterialStartMenu
A Material Icon Start Menu. Made within less than an hour but it still a basic tool for the Geogbra Classic exploit.

## Why?
I wanted a basic home menu for the Geogbra classic, it still needs some work but I think it is good enough. 

**NOTICE: This is not a tool for FreeExecutor! It is a standalone program that can act as a custom start page!**

## Development Progress:
- [x] Prototype
- [ ] Configuration
- [x] GitHub Page Instance
- [ ] Integrated Search Menu
- [ ] Stealth Mode?
- [ ] Custom Routing of Pages through another server (Proxying)?
